# edea python libary and tool

This is the edea commandline tool and kicad parser python library.

## Running the tool

To run the tool for test & development purposes either enter a venv or use poetry to run it:

```sh
# when outside the poetry environment, just run
poetry run python -m edea
# or
poetry shell
# now we're inside the venv and can run
python -m edea
```

## Running the tests

The tests should run in the venv to make sure the development tools are there:

```sh
# outside the poetry environment:
poetry run pytest
# or
poetry shell
# now we're inside the venv and can run like before, but now with test coverage
pytest --cov-report term-missing --cov=edea

# it's also possible to run a single test or a test class
pytest -k TestMetadata
```

### Long running test

`test_parse_all` parses a lot of KiCad 6 files which can take a long time. It
doesn't run by default if the files are not there but you can enable it by
getting them.

```sh
# the files are in the kicad6-test-files git submodule
git submodule update --init
# we'd like to parallelize the tests using pytest-xdist to speed things up
poetry shell
# run the tests, automatically detecting the optimal number of processes for your machine
pytest -n auto
```
